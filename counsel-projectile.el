;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Projectile has native support for using ivy as its completion
;; system.  Counsel-projectile provides further ivy integration into
;; projectile by taking advantage of ivy's mechanism to select from a
;; list of actions and/or apply an action without leaving the
;; comlpetion session.  It is inspired by helm-projectile.  See the
;; README for more details.
