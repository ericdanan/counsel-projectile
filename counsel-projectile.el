;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Projectile has native support for using ivy as its completion
;; system. Counsel-projectile provides further ivy integration into
;; projectile by taking advantage of ivy's support for selecting from
;; a list of actions and applying an action without leaving the
;; completion session. Concretely, counsel-projectile defines
;; replacements for existing projectile commands as well as new
;; commands that have no projectile counterparts. A minor mode is also
;; provided that adds key bindings for all these commands on top of
;; the projectile key bindings.

ACTION-VAR is a variable holding an action list whose first
element is the index of the default action in the list and the
remaining elements are the actions (a key, a function, and a name
for each action).

MODIFICATIONS is a list of modifications to be applied
sequentially to ACTION-LIST. Each modification has one of the
following formats:

    (remove ACTION-ITEM)
        Remove the action whose key, function, name, or index in
        the list (1 for the first action, etc) is ACTION-ITEM
        from the list.

    (add ACTION TARGET-ITEM)
        Add ACTION (a list containing a key, a function, and a
        name) to the list, just before the action whose key,
        function, name, or index in the list (1 for the first
        action, etc) is TARGET-ITEM.  If TARGET-ITEM is omitted,
        add the action at the end of the list.

    (move ACTION-ITEM TARGET-ITEM)
        Move the action whose key, function, name, or index in
        the list (1 for the first action, etc) is ACTION-ITEM
        just before the action whose key, function, name, or
        index in the list (1 for the first action, etc) is
        TARGET-ITEM.  If TARGET-ITEM is omitted, move the action
        to the end of the list.

    (setkey ACTION-ITEM KEY)
        Set the key of the action whose key, function, name, or
        index in the list (1 for the first action, etc) is
        ACTION-ITEM to KEY.

    (setfun ACTION-ITEM FUNCTION)
        Set the function of the action whose key, function, name,
        or index in the list (1 for the first action, etc) is
        ACTION-ITEM to FUNCTION.

    (setname ACTION-ITEM NAME)
        Set the name of the action whose key, function, name, or
        index in the list (1 for the first action, etc) is
        ACTION-ITEM to NAME.

    (default ACTION-ITEM)
        Set the index of the default action in the list to that
        of the action whose key, function, name, or index in the
        list (1 for the first action, etc) is ACTION-ITEM.

The format is the same as in `org-capture-templates', except that

root and name, respectively.

The default value contains a single template, whose target is:

    \(file+headline \"${root}/notes.org}\" \"Tasks\"\)

This points to headline \"Tasks\" in file \"notes.org\" in the
project root directory (one file per project).

Two other examples of valid targets are:

    \(file+headline \"${root}/${name}.org}\" \"Tasks\"\)
    \(file+olp \"~/notes.org\" \"${root}\" \"Tasks\"\)

The first one is similar to the default value's target, except
that the file is named after the project name (this can be handy
if you use org-mode's agenda since the project name is then
displayed as category). The second one points to outline path
\"<project-root>/Tasks\" in file \"~/notes.org\" (same file for
all projects)."
